# Kafka Connect

Use the Redpanda Console to create Kafka Connectors easily.

## Explore Elasticsearch indices

After you set up the Kafka connectors, you can search the Elasticsearch indices using the Elasticsearch REST-API. E.g. the announcements index:

```sh
curl "http://localhost:9200/announcements/_search"
```
